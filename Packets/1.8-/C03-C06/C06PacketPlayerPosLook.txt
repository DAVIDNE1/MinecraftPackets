C06PacketPlayerPosLook is a packet that is sent when both the clients rotation and position have changed since the last tick. 
Of course this means it contains the data of position, rotation, and groundstate.

This packet is also sent by the client when responding to S08PacketPlayerPosLook, a packet sent to the client by the server. 

Since I'm sure, based on the last two packets, you understand what this one does. 
However modifying this packet can be used to bypass a server, the most famous Minecraft server infact.

When the server sends a S08PacketPlayerPosLook to the server, you can cancel the vanilla response and instead send a C04PacketPlayerPosition. 

This packet will still of course contain the same position information as the C06 did, however on some anticheats, like Watchdog, it can disable strafe checks entirely.
